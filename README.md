# iss-location
Shows the exact location of the ISS on a map, plus NASA's live-streaming video from space.

Just for fun, my 10-year-old son and I built a new project together. It's a kind of ISS (International Space Station) tracker. Through this application, you can see both the current ISS location over the Earth on a map and the official NASA live-streaming video from the ISS in space. Such a breathtaking view! If you are lucky, sometimes you can hear the ISS crew talking to each other. I loved it.

Check it out and Enjoy it!

At the moment, it performs best on larger screens. I'll continue working on it to optimize it for mobile devices.
